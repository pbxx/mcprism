<h2 align="center">MCPrism</h2>
<p align="center">
  Turns public Minecraft Bedrock servers into LAN games on your network, no DNS changes required! The easiest way to join online servers on consoles without IP.
</p> 
<p align="center">
  Usage requires a PC or Mac to run MCPrism. It will act as a proxy between the console(s) on your LAN and the bedrock server on the internet.
</p> 
<p align="center">
  Once MCPrism is running, the active server will become visible in the "Friends" tab, on your console's Minecraft app.

<h2 align="center">Setup</h2>


<p align="left">
  Navigate to the latest release in the releases page, then download the binary for your platform.
  <br /><br />
  The Windows `.exe` is a portable executable, so no installation is needed. Simply open the application and add some servers! 
  <br />
  The MacOS `.dmg` installs like a normal MacOS/MacOSX application
</p>




Currently tested on Windows and MacOS.

<h2 align="center">Port configuration</h2>
MCPrism uses UDP ports 19132, as well as a random-selected port between 49000-65535 (by default). You can select a custom port range for the random port in the settings menu. 

<br />

<h2 align="center">How it works</h2>
MCPrism proxies Bedrock LAN traffic between your local network and a Minecraft server using UDP. This allows consoles to join internet Bedrock servers, normally only accessible by IP input, using your local network and the "friends" tab on Minecraft. 

<br />

<h2 align="center">Compatibility</h2>

MCPrism has currently been tested on x64 and arm64.
